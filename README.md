#Spaceship controlled using Phidget components

Simple setup of phidget componenets for controling the movement and laser of spaceship.

An Intellij project setup has been used. IDEA files have been included so that project can be directly opening in Intellij IDE.

Code has been precomplied into the Axteroids.jar file. However, source code will need to be edited for specific Phidget setup in the Controller.java file.
